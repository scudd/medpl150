  <h1>Gant Scudder</h1>

  <p>A storyteller above all else, my work is the result of an obsession with the endless narratives that surround me. Drawing inspiration from film noir,
  low budget horror, and gothic punk, my work is intended to hold a dark mirror up to the world, using art as a safe space to reflect on dark truths that can be too frightening or damaging to look at directly.
  Through film, text, and illustration, I explore themes of sexuality, violence, and power; with the intention of providing an outlet and escape for those who see their stories reflected in my work.
  As a student, I am still forming my visual language and artistic voice, and look forward to this class as an opportunity to hone my craft.</p>

   <h1>Creative Statement</h1>
