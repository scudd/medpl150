    <h2>On &quot;In Plato&apos;s Cave&quot;</h2>
    <p> Sontag dwells on what the photograph is extensively. Though it can be distorted by changing the subject, leaving information out of frame, or editing the image outright, there seems to be a fundamental truth to photography that is unlike other forms of art, or other forms of record. A camera can only capture what is there, and in so doing, turns the photograph&apos;s subject into a literal object. I think my relationship with photography is more informed by this view of objectification than most. My mother is a photographer, and years of seeing her clients pulled up in Lightroom trained my mind to view them not as individuals with their own rich inner world, but as still images, a part of the background of my home. I saw hundreds of faces belonging to people I would never know, yet I was privy to the perverse and intimate moments of editing. I began to see the camera as something unnatural- something about the subtractive nature of photography beginning to unnerve me. Not unlike the written word, I became acutely aware that every photograph left out far more than it included- not only the inner world of the subject, but the momentum of the scene, the details beyond the frame.

 I never adopted my mother&apos;s art form, preferring poetry and prose. With the written word, I had absolute control over my creations, and I found myself hesitant to engage with the visual medium as a whole. So much of it seemed permanent, indelible, and stark, where language allowed changes and fluidity. I remember vividly the rise of Instagram, suddenly all my peers were posting photos of their pets, their dinners, the small mundanities that made up their lives. This behavior is normative now, but at the time it felt alien and exhibitionistic. I never took up the habit of photographing my daily life, either. Selfies became their own language- specific poses, facial expressions, lighting techniques becoming common knowledge. Again, I fell behind my peers, unwilling or unable to engage in this visual language. My refusal to engage in social media began to manifest in a technical illiteracy that drove a small wedge between myself and my peers. 

Over the past few years, I&apos;ve renegotiated my relationship with the photograph. I carry a camera in my pocket, like the rest of the world, and I&apos;ve been known to use it to snap a photo of my cats, or my meals, or a quick selfie. Part of the reason for my enrollment in this course is in the hopes that I&apos;ll find a way to connect with the medium as my mother did - as art, rather than consumption. Understanding the generative power the medium holds, I&apos;m daunted but curious to find what I will choose to capture, what story I will choose to tell. Unlike the other art forms I engage in, I am bound by that which surrounds me- forcing me to look at the world through a different lens, in the hopes of seeing that which is worthy of documentation, preservation, and transformation with this new tool.
